I learned how to create a GraphQL database database on a Ruby on Rails framework. I used GraphQL to create a blockchain database to simulate the storing and querying of blocks and its associated transactions and addresses.


To simulate the database:

- clone the repo with git clone 
- turn on Rails server
- access GraphiQL: http://localhost:3000/graphiql
- to run the queries to return a block, transaction or address: find the query code inside the file: query_type.rb
- to run the mutation to create a transaction: find the mutation code inside the file: create_transaction.rb
